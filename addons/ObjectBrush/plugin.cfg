name="Object Brush"
description="Creates a custom node that comes with an object brush. This brush can be used to \"paint\" objects of one mesh across a collider. Supports painting and erasing, randomized scales and rotations, preset rotations, and collisions.

HOW TO USE:
-Add nodes of the type \"ObjectSet\" to the scene. Each ObjectSet represents one mesh. Do NOT change the instance count at any point. Set a mesh and any other settings.
-Click \"Paint\" at the top to paint. Painting can be done on any mesh marked with the terrain layer (7). Press A and D to rotate, which will override random rotations, and press S to reset rotations.
-Click \"Erase\" at the top to erase. The size of the erase depends on the brush radius."
